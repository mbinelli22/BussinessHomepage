# BussinessHomepage
Assignment 9 for Web Development class @ UW-M. 
In Brief: You will be creating a homepage for a business; you can use either real or fake business. Call the page assignment9.html and submit the URL to Canvas.

In Detail: You will be creating at least 4 different sections using div tags. Assign each DIV a different ID. The layout and styling of the different sections will be controlled with CSS. Your CSS will be written in a separate CSS file. Be creative, this is your chance to show what you have learned thus far with CSS.

A header (name of the business, can include a logo and a slogan)
Content section (little blurb about the business such as the industry and what it sells)
Footer (contains contact info like address, phone, and email)
One of the sections, preferably the header, will contain 4 or more hyperlinks that have been styled through CSS.
The links don’t need to go anywhere specific, but should have meaning for the site. So for example, if you have a clothing business you could create 4 links for men, women, juniors, and children.
Center all of the page content by setting the right and left margins Float 2 or more of the sections next to each other as shown in the demo from class 
— So 1 section of the layout will have at least a 2-column layout
Include an example of 1 media query with adjustments to your layout in the query
